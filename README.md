# Web-Scraping-Challenge

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.


This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Optionally export the data into a JSON file or a MongoDB database.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Instructions :

    Download the repository onto you computer.
    Open the part_1_mars_news.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook.
    Select the "Kernel" tab and click "Restart Kernel and Clear all Outputs".
    Then proceed to hit shift + enter to cycle through the script cell by cell.
    Then open the part_2_mars_weather.ipynb file.
    Select the "Kernel" tab and click "Restart Kernel and Clear all Outputs".
    Then proceed to hit shift + enter to cycle through the script cell by cell.
